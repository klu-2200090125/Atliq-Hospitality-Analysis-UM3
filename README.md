# Problem statement
Atliq Grands owns several five-star hotels across India. The company has been operating in the hotel industry for 20 years. Due to strategic moves by other competitors and ineffective management decisions, Atliq Grands is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. As a strategic move, the Managing Director of Atliq Grands wanted to bring in "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain market share and revenue. However, the company does not have a dedicated data analytics team to provide these insights.
The revenue management team has decided to hire an external service provider to provide insights from historical data.

# Task List

# Learnt things from this Project

i) Learned how to create a new visualization (Calendar visualization) using matrix tables which can be used for various analytical purposes.

ii) Looking at different cancellation policies of different hotels, I found that most of the hotels do not charge any fee unless the booking is cancelled within 3 months of the booking date. In case of post-booking cancellation, they charge a fee ranging from 60-90% of the booking fee.
